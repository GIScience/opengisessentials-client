# Info

This is the code for a supplementary test client to the publication "Web Portrayal Services" of the Series OpenGISEssentials written by Christine Andrae, Christian Graul, Martin Over and Alexander Zipf and published by Wichman Verlag.

The test client allows users to practically test OGC-SLDs using OGC-WMS, OGC-SLD, OGC-SymbologyEncoding and OGC-FilterEncoding.

This client has been provided by the GIScience Research Group of the Heidelberg University for many years from 2011 to 2019.

It is no longer maintained by the GIScience Reseach Group and thus made publicly available.
